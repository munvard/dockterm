## 🩹 What's new in v0.6.1 — prompt fix + a nicer installer

- **Fixed your shell prompt.** On bash, last release's directory-tracking could replace your normal prompt with a bare `bash-3.2$` (and drop your PATH) because it skipped the system login files. It now re-sources them, so your usual `host:dir user$` prompt — and your PATH — are back, with directory tracking still working.
- **Beautiful new macOS installer.** The DMG now has a polished, on-brand background instead of the plain gray window.
